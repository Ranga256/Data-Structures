Given a 2D integer array circles where circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri] represents the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid, 
return the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.

Input: circles = [[2,2,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The figure above shows the given circle.
The lattice points present inside the circle are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) and are shown in green.
Other points such as (1, 1) and (1, 3), which are shown in red, are not considered inside the circle.
Hence, the number of lattice points present inside at least one circle is 5.

class Solution {
    public int countLatticePoints(int[][] circles) {
        int co=0;
        for(int i=0;i<=200;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<=200;j++){
                for(int[] c:circles){
                    if((c[0]-i)*(c[0]-i)+(c[1]-j)*(c[1]-j)<=c[2]*c[2]){
                        co++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return co;
    }
}
